Incident Evidence Score -- deliberately never called a "fraud probability".

It is a transparent, weighted combination of independently-computed
0..1 components. Every component is itself a deterministic calculation
over financial-primitive data (see financial/baseline.py, entity
resolution, communication correlation); the LLM never touches this file.
