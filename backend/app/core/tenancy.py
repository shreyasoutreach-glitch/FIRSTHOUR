"""
Multi-tenancy enforcement.

The design goal: a developer writing a new route or service function should
have to go OUT OF THEIR WAY to leak data across tenants, not remember to
prevent it. That rules out "add .filter(tenant_id=...) to every query" as the
primary mechanism -- it's exactly the kind of thing that gets forgotten once,
which is all it takes for an IDOR.

TenantScopedSession subclasses sqlalchemy.orm.Session directly (rather than
wrapping it, or relying on `with_loader_criteria` global-filter events) and
overrides exactly three methods:

- get()   -- cross-tenant fetch-by-primary-key returns None (treated as
             not-found, not forbidden -- this avoids confirming that a
             resource exists to a caller who isn't allowed to see it).
- query() -- automatically ANDs a tenant_id filter onto any TenantScoped
             entity being queried, before any .filter()/.join()/etc. the
             caller chains on top.
- add()   -- auto-stamps tenant_id on a new object if the caller didn't set
             one already, from the session's own current tenant.

This was verified empirically before being adopted -- see the two throwaway
scripts run during development, which is also why `with_loader_criteria` was
NOT used: it does not reliably cover Session.get() across SQLAlchemy
versions, and a security mechanism that "usually" works is not a security
mechanism.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER (documented honestly, not hidden):
- Raw SQL / session.execute(text(...)) is not filtered. Nothing in this
  codebase currently does that (verified: no `session.execute(text(` or
  raw cursor usage anywhere in app/), but a future contributor adding raw
  SQL would silently bypass tenant scoping. A production hardening pass
  should add a lint rule or code-review checklist item for this.
- SQLAlchemy relationship()-based lazy loading is not intercepted (this
  codebase does not declare any `relationship()` attributes -- everything
  is explicit FK columns and manual queries -- so this gap has zero surface
  area today, but would need the same treatment if relationships were added
  later).
- This is tenant *identification* enforcement, not tenant *authentication*.
  Combined with the RBAC layer (app/core/authz.py), a request's tenant comes
  from a verified user's bearer token, not a client-supplied header --
  see authz.py for exactly where identity is established.
